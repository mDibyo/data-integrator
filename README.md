# data-integrator

Data usually comes in as a real-time stream. However, not all new data coming in is relevant. As such, incoming data could have a similar pattern to past data or could be the same as data received at an immediately previous moment. In such cases, the data can be "coompressed"/integrated with past data for a more compact representation which still retains all the relevant information.
